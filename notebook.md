- How do you align something to the left or right?
- What widget adds space around content?

## Flutter Definitions

| Term | Definition and Description | Base Structure | Real Life Example | App Example |

|------|----------------------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|

| main()     | A function that runs when your app starts. It tells Flutter what app to show. | `void main() => runApp(MyApp());` |Like turning on a TV and choosing which channel (app) to watch.  |in main.dart, void main() => runApp (MyPortfolioApp());  |

|MaterialApp      | The widget that sets up your whole app’s look and navigation. | `MaterialApp(...)` |Like the frame or theme for a building.  |  |

|Scaffold      | A widget that gives you the basic layout: background, navigation bar, floating button, etc. | `Scaffold(...)` |Like the structure of a house with rooms and floors.  |  |

|Column      | A widget that holds and displays your content in a straight line from top to bottom. | `Column(...)` |A stack of boxes or books.  |  |

|Row      | A widget that shows things side-by-side. | `Row(...)` |A row of chairs.  |  |

|Container      | A box that holds other widgets. You can add color, padding, borders, or size. | `Container(...)` |A box you decorate and put things inside.  |  |

|ElevatedButton      | A clickable button that floats above content. You choose what happens when it's clicked. | `ElevatedButton(onPressed: ..., child: ...)` |A doorbell – when you press it, something happens.  |  |

|onPressed      | The code that gets run when a button is tapped or something happens. | `onPressed: () => doSomething()` |Pressing a button to play music.  |  |

|StatelessWidget      | A class that creates widgets that never change. Good for static screens. | `class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget` |A poster on a wall – doesn’t change.  |  |

|StatefulWidget      | A class for widgets that can change while the app is running. | `class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget` |A remote control – its state (channel/volume) changes.  |  |

|Navigator.pushNamed      | Lets you move from one screen to another using route names. | `Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/about')` |Going into a different room in a house.  |  |

## Markdown Style Guide for Coding Notebooks

Follow this guide to keep your coding notebook **clear, consistent, and professional**.  
This ensures your notes are easy for you (and others) to read later.

---

## 🔹 Headings
**When to use:** Organize your notebook into sections (like days, topics, or projects).  
- `#` for the notebook title (use once at the top).  
- `##` for each day or major topic.  
- `###` for subsections (like "Notes", "Practice", "Reflections").  

✅ Example:


# My Coding Notebook
## Day 1
### Notes
### Practice

🔡 Text Formatting
When to use: Highlight important ideas or add emphasis.

Use bold for key terms or definitions.

Use italic for emphasis or side comments.

Use inline code for keywords, functions, or commands.

 

✅ Example:

**Class** = a blueprint for objects  
*Remember:* always test your code  
Use `System.out.println()` to print

 

💻 Code Blocks
When to use: Anytime you write multiple lines of code.

Inline code for short snippets.

Fenced code blocks with language for full examples.

✅ Example:

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

🧾 Lists
When to use: Organize steps, notes, or key points.

Numbered lists for sequences or steps.

Bulleted lists for unordered ideas.

✅ Example:

1. Define the class
2. Write the main method
3. Test your program

Variables
- Loops
- Conditionals
 

✅ Checklists
When to use: Track progress on assignments or tasks.

✅ Example:

[x] Complete coding warm-up
- [ ] Finish project draft
- [ ] Reflect on learning

 

➡️ Blockquotes
When to use: Call out notes, reminders, or teacher comments.

✅ Example:

> 💡 Remember: Loops repeat code until a condition is false.

 

📊 Tables
When to use: Compare values, track progress, or organize data neatly.

✅ Example:

| Task        | Status   | Notes          |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| Homework 1  | Done ✅  | Submitted      |
| Homework 2  | Pending  | Needs review   |

 

🔗 Links & Images
When to use: Add references, resources, or visuals.

✅ Example:

[Java Docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/)  
![Markdown Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Markdown-mark.svg)

 

📂 Collapsible Sections
When to use: Hide solutions, extended notes, or extra details.

✅ Example:

<details>
  <summary>Click to reveal solution</summary>
  
System.out.println("Answer: 42");

</details>

 

📝 Footnotes
When to use: Add references or side notes without cluttering the page.

✅ Example:

This concept is related to object-oriented programming.[^1]

[^1]: See "Objects and Classes" in your textbook.

 

🎯 Style Rules
Consistency matters more than creativity

Always use headings to structure your notes.

Always use code blocks for multi-line code.

Clarity first

Bold key terms.

Use lists instead of long sentences when outlining steps.

Professional tone

Don’t mix casual notes with formal work in the same section.

Use blockquotes for reflections or teacher feedback.

Track your learning

Use checklists to mark what’s done.

Use collapsible sections if you want to hide answers until review time.

 

✅ Bottom Line:

Headings = Structure

Bold/Italic = Emphasis

Code blocks = Code

Lists = Steps/Ideas

Tables = Organization

Checklists = Progress

Blockquotes = Notes/Tips

Collapsible = Hide/Show detail

Keep it simple, consistent, and clear.
